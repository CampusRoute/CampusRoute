Hey guys!

I'm excited to share the progress I've made in the latest update of CampusRoute. In this devlog, I'll walk you through the key changes and improvements I've implemented. Let's dive in!

1. New UI Design:
   I've given CampusRoute a fresh new look! I've been working hard to revamp the user interface, focusing on enhancing usability and providing a more intuitive experience. With a cleaner and more modern design, navigating through the app has never been easier. Just take a look at the screenshot below to see the updated UI in action.

2. Improved Route Status Page:
   To keep our users informed during their journeys, I've introduced an enhanced route status page. Now, when you visit /status within the app, you'll be redirected to a page that indicates the current operational status of the CampusRoute website. This way, you'll always know if the website is up and running smoothly or if there are any temporary disruptions or maintenance activities affecting its availability. We're continuously working on further enhancements to provide real-time updates about your navigation within the app, ensuring you have the most accurate information at your fingertips.

That's it for now, folks! I'm thrilled about the progress we've made so far, and I can't wait to bring you more exciting updates in the next devlog. As always, thank you for your support and stay tuned for the latest CampusRoute news!
