I really like using Markdown

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

This text is ***really important***.

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
